# welcome!
This is Bartok, a system that is being created to help you create, run, and manage your code!

With Bartok, your code is collected into collections of files called services.  There are two main types of services: frontend and backend.  Frontend services are ran and executed in a browser.  Backend services run on a server.

This instance of Bartok runs only frontend services.  If you want backend services, visit the [github repository](https://github.com/crosshj/experiments/tree/gh-pages/bartok), clone, and follow instructions.

You can use this frontend-only version of Bartok as an editor and to explore the Bartok templates and preview.  You'll need to create your own service because the `welcome` service will not persist changes to local storage in your browser for this special, introductory service.

Currently, this is a work in progress, but you can play around!

If you want an idea of what bartok can do, check out:

  - `terminal` pane, the right part of the screen.
	Try entering `help` then press `Enter` - not everything works, but some things do!!

  - `preview` mode can be chosen in the menu atop the terminal pane.
	Use it when you browse file examples.

  - `file-examples` folder, to the left in explorer tree.
	Try clicking one of these files and watching `preview` pane.

  - `.templates` folder, at the top of the file tree on the left.
	Exploring this will give you an idea of how `preview` works

  - `service map` screen, appears after clicking the triangular icon near top, far left .
	This shows connected services and connections within services.

Feel free to edit anything!  In Bartok's current state, you won't hurt anything!
