### about the name

bartok was a music composer   
original idea for this editor was frontend for a service composer   
a fugue is a form of musical composition
fiug.dev is how you spell it if you are me trying to find a catchy/short/available domain name 



### how to run

I'm working on making this as easy as https://fiug.dev (try it out!)

That may not be working all the time... or now.

to run UI locally:
- git clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch` 

to run server:
- run UI as above
- `npm run watch.server` 

there is also a basic server which does much less than what I had this server doing, see "about the name"

other names for this service considered:

- (https://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/ - searching for "coordinator")
- mratibu - Swahili - "organizer or coordinator"
- alakoso - Yoruba - "director, ruler"
- catechist - (one of the things alakso can mean) because it sounds cool, "to question or instruct" related to Christian religion
- ... and more, forgot those (and you don't really care, do you?)
