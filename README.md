### about the name

This project is called `fiug` but it wasn't always.  First it was called `bartok`, because it was to be a service composer.

bartok was a music composer   
the original idea for this editor was frontend for a service composer   

a fugue is a form of musical composition   
fiug.dev is how you spell it if you are me trying to find a catchy/short/available domain name   

I'm working on thinking more of this as `fiug` and less as `bartok` but maybe the later still has a life, dunno   

Long story short: `fiug` is a front-end for another (languishing) project called `bartok`.

### how to run

Go to [https://fiug.dev](https://fiug.dev) (try it out!)


### how to run locally (may not even be working)
to run UI:
- git clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch` 

to run server:
- run UI as above
- `npm run watch.server` 

there is also a basic server which does much less than what I had this server doing, see "about the name"

other names for this service considered:

- (https://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/ - searching for "coordinator")
- mratibu - Swahili - "organizer or coordinator"
- alakoso - Yoruba - "director, ruler"
- catechist - (one of the things alakso can mean) because it sounds cool, "to question or instruct" related to Christian religion
- ... and more, forgot those (and you don't really care, do you?)
